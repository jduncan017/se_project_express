# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

WTWR is a robust back-end server designed to power the "What to Wear?" application. This project emphasizes on building a deeper comprehension of essential back-end concepts including database operations, security implementations, rigorous testing, and efficient deployment strategies.

## Core Features:

- **API Design:** Well-structured API endpoints to cater to the application's needs.
- **Database Operations:** Efficient CRUD operations using MongoDB and Mongoose for smooth data handling.

## Technologies Used:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: Asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime.
- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**: Minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**: Scalable and flexible NoSQL database.
- **[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)**: Platform for API development.

## Node Packages Used

- **[Express-Rate-Limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit)**: Rate Limiter
- **[Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)**: Validator for schemas
- **[Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/)**: Express Security Package

By working on this project, I've honed my skills in designing efficient back-end architectures and understanding the intricacies of server management and API design.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

## Future Updates

I plan to add a images and a video overview to this Readme at a later date.
